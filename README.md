## üñåÔ∏è Scope of the Project 

- **User-friendly Website:** A user-friendly website where students from various universities and colleges can easily log in and share comprehensive details about their academic projects.
- **Personalized Profiles:** Students and users begin by creating a personalized profile on the website. Users can create posts that contain in-depth descriptions of their academic projects.
- **Knowledge Sharing:** Users can also share research materials, references, and datasets associated with their projects, enhancing the educational aspect of the platform.
- **Seamless Experience:** This platform provides a seamless experience for students to showcase their academic work, offers valuable resources for those seeking inspiration, and encourages knowledge sharing and collaboration among the academic community.
- **Search and Recommendation Algorithms:** Implementing more search and recommendation algorithms can help users find projects that align with their interests and needs more effectively.
- **Mentorship and Peer Review:** Incorporating mentorship programs and peer review processes to provide constructive feedback and guidance to students working on projects.
- **User Feedback and Continuous Improvement:** Continuously gathering feedback from users to make improvements and enhancements to the platform based on their needs and suggestions.
- **Enhanced Plagiarism Detection:** Expanding the platform's plagiarism-checking capabilities by integrating plagiarism detection tools and algorithms.
- **Industry Collaboration for Talent Scouting:** Partnering with industry leaders to grant them access to student profiles and project portfolios, facilitating the identification of promising candidates for job opportunities.

## üõ†Ô∏è Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.

### `npm build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

### `npm eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can‚Äôt go back!**

If you aren‚Äôt satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you‚Äôre on your own.

You don‚Äôt have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn‚Äôt feel obligated to use this feature. However, we understand that this tool wouldn‚Äôt be useful if you couldn‚Äôt customize it when you are ready for it.
